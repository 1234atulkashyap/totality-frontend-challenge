## Project Overview

This project is a frontend challenge built using React and Vite. The application demonstrates a modern web development stack, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite for a fast development experience. The goal of this project is to provide a scalable, maintainable, and efficient frontend application.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that offers fast development server and optimized build process.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.

## Approach

1. **Project Setup**: 
   - Initialized the project using Vite for a streamlined development process.
   - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive styling.
   - Configured ESLint and PostCSS for code quality and CSS transformations.

2. **Component Structure**:
   - The project follows a component-based architecture typical in React applications. 
   - Reusable components are stored in the `src/components` directory, and are organized based on their functionality.

3. **Styling**:
   - Tailwind CSS is used throughout the project for styling. This approach allows for rapid development and easy customization of styles directly in the components.

4. **State Management**:
   - React's built-in state management is used to handle component states. For larger applications, a state management library like Redux or Context API can be integrated.

5. **Build and Deployment**:
   - The project is configured to build efficiently using Vite, producing optimized assets ready for deployment.
